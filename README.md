### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice of you to have stumbled here in my humble abode!ðŸ˜„ I am anastasya, a (fresh) grad of Chem with a minor in data science! 

ðŸŒ±

I like all kinds of data thingy with all its glitter of analysis! Also very much in love with machine learning and all its glory, sometimes when I am feeling particularly adventurous I would delved into artificial intelligenceâœ¨. 
But for now, data science in my kinda jam (my ninja path if you will, lol)

ðŸŒ±

In my free time, I enjoy reading (fantasy, science fiction, action(?), and personal development if I am feeling particularly energetic lol) . I'm also a big fan of learning new things and taking on new challenges. Life's all about learning dont cha think?
